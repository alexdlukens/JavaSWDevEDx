Java Software Development Projects
## About
- This repository contains several projects from my refresh to Java via the PennX Software Development course on [EDx](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/pennx-computer-science-essentials-for-software-development)
- As I complete these projects, I am seeking an entry-level position in Software Development. Please contact me via my email: alexdlukens@gmail.com if I may be of use to your dev team
